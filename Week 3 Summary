- You can use the WHERE clause to refine your query results.
- You can use the wildcard character (%) as a substitute for unknown characters in a pattern.
- You can use BETWEEN ... AND ... to specify a range of numbers.
- You can sort query results into ascending or descending order, using the ORDER BY clause to specify the column to sort on.
- You can group query results by using the GROUP BY clause. 

- Most databases come with built-in functions that you can use in SQL statements to perform operations on data within the database itself.
- When you work with large datasets, you may save time by using built-in functions rather than first retrieving the data into your application 
and then executing functions on the retrieved data.
- You can use sub-queries to form more powerful queries than otherwise.
- You can use a sub-select expression to evaluate some built-in aggregate functions like the average function. 
- Derived tables or table expressions are sub-queries where the outer query uses the results of the sub-query as a data source.
